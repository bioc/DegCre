Description: DegCre generates associations between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) based on non-parametric concordance between differential data. The user provides GRanges of DEG TSS and CRE regions with differential p-value and optionally log-fold changes and DegCre returns an annotated Hits object with associations and their calculated probabilities. Additionally, the package provides functionality for visualization and conversion to other formats.
