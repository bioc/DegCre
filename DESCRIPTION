Description:
    DegCre generates associations between differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
    and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) based on non-parametric concordance 
    between differential data. The user provides GRanges of DEG TSS and CRE 
    regions with differential p-value and optionally log-fold changes and 
    DegCre returns an annotated Hits object with associations and their 
    calculated probabilities. Additionally, the package provides functionality 
    for visualization and conversion to other formats.
